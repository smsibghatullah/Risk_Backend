Subject: Request for Assistance - Unable to Book 1-1 Session

Dear Sir Imtiaz Hussain,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Muhammad Adnan, and I am a student in cohort 7 of the Front-End Development program at the Institute of Emerging Careers (IEC). I am writing to you today to address an issue I have encountered while attempting to book a 1-1 session with you.

As per our program requirements, I have been trying to schedule a meeting with you to discuss certain aspects of the course and seek your guidance on a few topics. However, I have encountered a challenge in finding an available slot in the calendar provided via the provided link.

Despite my diligent efforts to explore the calendar and check for any free slots, it appears that there are no available time slots for the entire month. I have checked multiple times to ensure that I did not overlook any openings, but unfortunately, I have been unable to find a suitable time for our 1-1 session.

Given the importance of these sessions and the valuable insights you provide, I would greatly appreciate it if we could find a mutually convenient time to meet and discuss the matters at hand. If possible, could you please suggest an alternative method or provide an updated calendar with available slots so that I can select a time that works for both of us?

I understand that your schedule may be extremely busy, and I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. However, I believe that a dedicated 1-1 session would greatly benefit my learning journey and provide the necessary guidance to progress effectively.

Thank you for your understanding and support. I am eager to receive your guidance and assistance. Please let me know of any alternative arrangements or options we can explore to schedule our 1-1 session.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Warm regards,

Muhammad Adnan
